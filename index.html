      <h3>Hello!</h3>
      <p>Welcome to my humble first pass at having a web presence.
        This site is currently under construction, so if you find any bugs or have content suggestions/requests please let me know at pmcote1 at gmail.com</p>
      <p>A little background on where I am now, what I’ve been up to in the past, and where I want to go in the future.</p>

      <h4>Where I Am Now</h4>
      <p>Physically, for the next few months, I’m located in São Paulo, Brazil while on Leave of Absence from my usual occupation as a student at Olin College.
         I came here to work for Insper, a business school in São Paulo that is in the middle of starting a brand new engineering school with a project based curriculum.
         My work here involves collaborating with students and professors in the engineering school on various projects like assisting with design of their computing curriculum, organizing hackathons, and organizing their first student exposition.
      </p>

      <h4>Where I'm Going Next</h4>
      <p>
        I will return to Olin to complete my remaining two semesters in Sping 2016.
        I’m currently searching for internships for Summer 2016, in the development or product management space.
        If you’re interested in hiring me, take a look at my <a href="Fall2015Resume_PaigeCote.pdf">resume</a>.
